success that mean more perfect polish can be obtain question is often ask whi is it that plate receiv coat so unevenli i will answer say that it may aris two caus first most gener caus is that those part plate s surfac which will receiv heaviest coat have been more thoroughli polish consequ is that it is more sensit chemic oper second might perhap be consid part first heat plate may not be equal all it part thi may aris heat caus friction buf it is well known fact which everi observ practition is familiar that silver plate temperatur 45 deg or less expos vapor iodin is less sensit take longer time coat than when it is temperatur 60 deg or more whenev view is be taken or ani impress which requir plate be turn side it should be buf other direct so that mark will alway be horizont when pictur is posit finest possibl polish plate is readi coat box question is often ask oper what is state plate when polish allow stand time use meet thi point we hare onli consid silver power act it pure atmospher doe not act silver but we do not have thi our oper room as it is more or less charg sulphur hydrogen which soon tarnish surfac plate film brown sulphur it is thi that sometim caus speck which appear finish impress are great annoy henc we see that plate should be buf just receiv vapor iodin mr hunt give hi opinion use dilut nitric acid as best solut free surfac plate he say numer experi plate copper pure silver plate silver glass paper have convinc me that first oper polish nitric acid etc is essenti product most sensit surfac all who will take troubl examin subject will soon be convinc that acid soften silver bring it state which it is extrem suscept be either oxyd or iodiz accord as circumst may occur it exposur atmospher or iodin i cannot see object thi solut not howev gener use our oper do not find it suffici import success their pictur accept it alcohol solut be it natur less objection i will say here that plate submit onli ordinari polish is found contain numberless minut particl powder made use should same plate be buf long time polish will nearli all disappear leav caviti surfac free action agent employ subsequ oper thi reason i find that great amount polish powder should not be appli last buff it is obviou that three buff can be employ adventur two last should not receiv ani polish materi i have examin plate that wa consid possess fine finish similar had produc good impress these same plate when subject long light buf would present surfac no finer appear nake eye but exposur solar radiat would produc well defin imag one fourth less

slide exposur plate these vapor they can readili be obtain applic ani dealer all whom can furnish them princip difficulti coat plate is that preserv exact proport quantiti iodin bromin or quick it is here necessari say that hardli ani two person see alik same degre color so as be enabl judg correctli exact tint i e what one might describ as light rose red might appear anoth as bright or cherri red consequ onli rule student daguerreotyp is studi what appear him be particular tint or shade requir aid him produc desir result practis ha prove that but slight variat chemic coat daguerreotyp plate will veri materi affect final result oper will proport coat iodin bromin or acceler accord strength composit latter experi prove that common impress iodiz rather light yellow gold tint brought bromin veri light rose color have their white veri intens their deep shade veri black it is also known that if you employ thicker coat iodin appli it proportion tint bromin so as obtain deep rose tint delin will be less mark imag have softer tone thi effect ha been obviou everyon who ha practis art thu i may observ that light coat produc strong contrast light shade that thi contrast grow gradual less veri heavi coat it almost wholli disappear thi it will readili be perceiv that middl shade are one be desir repres harmoni blend light shade then if we examin respect strength or depth tone sharp impress we see that light coat produc veri sharp but shallow impress while other extrem give deep but veri dull one here then are still better reason avoid either extrem chang which plate pass coat may be consid yellow straw color or dark orang yellow rose color more or less dark tint or red violet steel blue or indigo lastli green attain thi latter color plate resum light yellow tint continu pass success second time veri few except all shade mention i will here present some excel remark thi subject mr finley thi gentleman say it is well known all who have given much attent subject that excess iodin give light portion object peculiar strength clear while darker part are retard as it were not brought that length exposur which suffic former henc statuari monument all object like charact were remark well delin origin process daguerr plate be coat iodin alon excess bromin certain degre ha opposit effect white portion impress appear dull leaden hue while those which should be black or dark appear quit light thi be case i conclud there must be point two extrem where light dark object will be photogen equilibrium great object therefor is maintain as nearli as possibl perfect balanc two element enter union form sensit coat plate order that light shade be truli faith repres that all object light or dark be made appear so far conform natur as is consist differ photogen energi differ color ray light it is thi nice balanc combin which ensur highest degre union essenti qualiti fine daguerreotyp viz clear strength soft puriti tone so far as i know it is univers practic oper judg proport iodin bromin coat plate two standard color one fix iodin other addit coat bromin now i maintain that these alon form veri fallaci standard first becaus color appear eye either lighter or darker accord as there is more or less light which we inspect coat secondli becaus if it occur that we are deceiv obtain exact tint first coat we are wors misl obtain second if iodin coat be too light then undu proport bromin is use order bring it second standard vice versa iodin box should be kept clean dri plate immedi last buf should be place iodin coat will depend charact tone impress desir coat dri iodin orang color then acceler light rose back iodin one sixth as long as first coat will produc fine soft tone is coat gener use most acceler plate iodiz dark orang yellow or ting slightli incipi rose color coat acceler deep rose red then back iodin one tenth as long as first coat give clear strong bold deep impress i will here state singular fact which is not gener known oper if plate coat iodin rose red then expos strong dri quick or weak bromin water so that chang color can be seen then recoat iodin twice as long as first coat it will be found far more sensit when expos light than when it ha been recoat iodin one fourth time first coat probabl best acceler combin is american compound formerli known as gurney s american compound or some combin bromid lime first
