never accid _ good while i said myself everi morn now i have escap thu far so chanc are just that much increas that i shall catch it thi time i will be shrewd buy accid ticket dead moral certainti i drew blank went bed that night joint start or bone splinter i got tire that sort daili bother fell buy accid ticket that were good month i said myself man _can t_ buy thirti blank one bundl but i wa mistaken there wa never prize lot i could read railway accid everi day newspap atmospher wa foggi them but somehow they never came my way i found i had spent good deal money accid busi had noth show it my suspicion were arous i began hunt around somebodi that had won thi lotteri i found plenti peopl who had invest but not individu that had ever had accid or made cent i stop buy accid ticket went cipher result wa astound peril lay not travel but stay home i hunt statist wa amaz find that all glare newspap headlin concern railroad disast less than _three hundred_ peopl had realli lost their live those disast preced twelv month eri road wa set down as most murder list it had kill forti six or twenti six i do not exactli rememb which but i know number wa doubl that ani other road but fact straightway suggest itself that eri wa immens long road did more busi than ani other line countri so doubl number kill ceas be matter surpris further figur it appear that new york rochest eri ran eight passeng train each way everi day 16 altogeth carri daili averag 6 000 person that is million six month popul new york citi well eri kill 13 23 person _its_ million six month same time 13 000 new york s million die their bed my flesh crept my hair stood end thi is appal i said danger isn t travel rail but trust those deadli bed i will never sleep bed again i had figur consider less than one half length eri road it wa plain that entir road must transport least eleven or twelv thousand peopl everi day there are mani short road run boston that do fulli half as much great mani such road there are mani road scatter union that do prodigi passeng busi therefor it wa fair presum that averag 2 500 passeng day each road countri would be almost correct there are 846 railway line our countri 846 time 2 500 are 2 115 000 so railway america move more than two million peopl everi day six hundr fifti million peopl year count sunday they do that too there is no question it though where they get raw materi is clear jurisdict my arithmet i have hunt censu i find that there are not that mani peopl unit state matter six hundr ten million veri least they must use some same peopl again like san francisco is one eighth as popul as new york there are 60 death week former 500 week latter if they have luck that is 3 120 death year san francisco eight time as mani new york say 25 000 or 26 000 health two place is same so we will let it stand as fair presumpt that thi will hold good all countri that consequ 25 000 everi million peopl we have must die everi year that amount one fortieth our total popul one million us then die annual thi million ten or twelv thousand are stab shot drown hang poison or meet similarli violent death some other popular way such as perish kerosen lamp hoop

can it sour milk but it doesn t matter i can get use that kind milk it is not account hi bright that i love him no it is not that he is not blame hi bright such as it is he did not make it himself he is as god made him that is suffici there wa wise purpos it _that _i know time it will develop though i think it will not be sudden besid there is no hurri he is well enough just as he is it is not
