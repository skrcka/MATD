say concern restor which ha been spoken behold some have wrest scriptur have gone far astray becaus thi thing i perceiv that thi mind ha been worri also concern thi thing but behold i will explain it unto thee 41 2 i say unto thee my son that plan restor is requisit justic god it is requisit that all thing should be restor their proper order behold it is requisit just accord power resurrect christ that soul man should be restor it bodi that everi part bodi should be restor itself 41 3 it is requisit justic god that men should be judg accord their work if their work were good thi life desir their heart were good that they should also last day be restor unto that which is good 41 4 if their work are evil they shall be restor unto them evil therefor all thing shall be restor their proper order everi thing it natur frame mortal rais immort corrupt incorrupt rais endless happi inherit kingdom god or endless miseri inherit kingdom devil one one hand other other 41 5 one rais happi accord hi desir happi or good accord hi desir good other evil accord hi desir evil as he ha desir do evil all day long even so shall he have hi reward evil when night cometh 41 6 so it is other hand if he hath repent hi sin desir righteous end hi day even so he shall be reward unto righteous 41 7 these are they that are redeem lord yea these are they that are taken that are deliv that endless night dark thu they stand or fall behold they are their own judg do good or do evil 41 8 now decre god are unalter therefor way is prepar that whosoev will may walk therein be save 41 9 now behold my son do not risk one more offens against your god those point doctrin which ye have hitherto risk commit sin 41 10 do not suppos becaus it ha been spoken concern restor that ye shall be restor sin happi behold i say unto you wicked never wa happi 41 11 now my son all men that are state natur or i would say carnal state are gall bitter bond iniqu they are god world they have gone contrari natur god therefor they are state contrari natur happi 41 12 now behold is mean word restor take thing natur state place it unnatur state or place it state opposit it natur 41 13 o my son thi is not case but mean word restor is bring back again evil evil or carnal carnal or devilish devilish good that which is good righteou that which is righteou just that which is just merci that which is merci 41 14 therefor my son see that you are merci unto your brethren deal justli judg righteous do good continu if ye do all these thing then shall ye receiv your reward yea ye shall have merci restor unto you again ye shall have justic restor unto you again ye shall have righteou judgment restor unto you again ye shall have good reward unto you again 41 15 that which ye do send shall return unto you again be restor therefor word restor more fulli condemneth sinner justifieth him not all alma chapter 42 42 1 now my son i perceiv there is somewhat more which doth worri your mind which ye cannot understand which is concern justic god punish sinner ye do tri suppos that it is injustic that sinner should be consign state miseri 42 2 now behold my son i will explain thi thing unto thee behold lord god sent our first parent forth garden eden till ground whenc they were taken yea he drew man he place east end garden eden cherubim flame sword which turn everi way keep tree life 42 3 now we see that man had becom as god know good evil lest he should put forth hi hand take also tree life eat live forev lord god place cherubim flame sword that he should not partak fruit 42 4 thu we see that there wa time grant unto man repent yea probationari time time repent serv god 42 5 behold if adam had put forth hi hand immedi partaken tree life he would have live forev accord word god have no space repent yea also word god would have been void great plan salvat would have been frustrat 42 6 but behold it wa appoint unto man die therefor as they were cut off tree life they should be cut off face earth man becam lost forev yea they becam fallen man 42 7 now ye see thi that our first parent were cut off both tempor spiritu presenc lord thu we see they becam subject follow their own will 42 8 now behold it wa not expedi that man should be reclaim thi tempor death that would destroy great plan happi 42 9 therefor as soul could never die fall had brought all mankind spiritu death as well as tempor that is they were cut off presenc lord it wa expedi that mankind should be reclaim thi spiritu death 42 10 therefor as they had becom carnal sensual devilish natur thi probationari state becam state them prepar it becam preparatori state 42 11 now rememb my son if it were not plan redempt lay it asid as soon as they were dead their soul were miser be cut off presenc lord 42 12 now there wa no mean reclaim men thi fallen state which man had brought himself becaus hi own disobedi 42 13 therefor accord justic plan redempt could not be brought onli condit repent men thi probationari state yea thi preparatori state it were these condit merci could not take effect it should destroy work justic now work justic could not be destroy if so god would ceas be god 42 14 thu we see that all mankind were fallen they were grasp justic yea justic god which consign them forev be cut off hi presenc 42 15 now plan merci could not be brought aton should be made therefor god himself atoneth sin world bring plan merci appeas demand justic that god might be perfect just god merci god also 42 16 now repent could not come unto men there were punish which also wa etern as life soul should be affix opposit plan happi which wa as etern also as life soul 42 17 now how could man repent he should sin how could he sin if there wa no law how could there be law save there wa punish 42 18 now there wa punish affix just law given which brought remors conscienc unto man 42 19 now if there wa no law given if man murder he should die would he be afraid he would die if he should murder 42 20 also if there wa no law given against sin men would not be afraid sin 42 21 if there wa no law given if men sin what could justic do or merci either they would have no claim creatur 42 22 but there is law given punish affix repent grant which repent merci claimeth otherwis justic claimeth creatur executeth law law inflicteth punish if not so work justic would be destroy god would ceas be god 42 23 but god ceaseth not be god merci claimeth penit merci cometh becaus aton aton bringeth pass resurrect dead resurrect dead bringeth back men presenc god thu they are restor hi presenc be judg accord their work accord law justic 42 24 behold justic exerciseth all hi demand also merci claimeth all which is her own thu none but truli penit are save 42 25 what do ye suppos that merci can rob justic i say unto you nay not one whit if so god would ceas be god 42 26 thu god bringeth hi great etern purpos which were prepar foundat world thu cometh salvat redempt men also their destruct miseri 42 27 therefor o my son whosoev will come may come partak water life freeli whosoev will not come same is not compel come but last day it shall be restor unto him accord hi deed 42 28 if he ha desir do evil ha not repent hi day behold evil shall be done unto him accord restor god 42 29 now my son i desir that ye should let these thing troubl you no more onli let your sin troubl you that troubl which shall bring you down unto repent 42 30 o my son i desir that ye should deni justic god no more do not endeavor excus yourself least point becaus your sin deni justic god but do you let
