some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnat is just 3 9 what then are we better than they no no wise we have prove both jew gentil that they are all sin 3 10 as it is written there is none righteou no not one 3 11 there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh god 3 12 they are all gone way they are togeth becom unprofit there is none that doeth good

justifi circumcis faith uncircumcis faith 3 31 do we then make void law faith god forbid yea we establish law 4 1 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertain flesh hath found 4 2 if abraham were justifi work he hath whereof glori but not god 4 3 what saith scriptur abraham believ god it wa count unto him righteous 4 4 now him that worketh is reward not reckon grace but debt 4 5 but him that worketh not but believeth him that justifieth ungodli hi faith is count righteous 4 6 even as david also describeth blessed man unto whom god imputeth righteous work 4 7 say bless are they whose iniqu are forgiven whose sin are cover 4 8 bless is man whom lord will not imput sin 4 9 cometh thi blessed then circumcis onli or uncircumcis also we say that faith wa reckon abraham righteous 4 10 how wa it then reckon when he wa circumcis or uncircumcis not circumcis but uncircumcis 4 11 he receiv sign circumcis seal righteous faith which he had yet be uncircumcis that he might be father all them that believ though they be not circumcis that righteous might be imput unto them also 4 12 father circumcis them who are not circumcis onli but who also walk step that faith our father abraham which he had be yet uncircumcis 4 13 promis that he should be heir world wa not abraham or hi seed law but righteous faith 4 14 if they which are law be heir faith is made void promis made none effect 4 15 becaus law worketh wrath where no law is there is no transgress 4 16 therefor it is faith that it might be grace end promis might be sure all seed not that onli which is law but that also which is faith abraham who is father us all 4 17 as it is written i have made thee father mani nation him whom he believ even god who quickeneth dead calleth those thing which be not as though they were 4 18 who against hope believ hope that he might becom father mani nation accord that which wa spoken so shall thi seed be 4 19 be not weak faith he consid not hi own bodi now dead when he wa hundr year old neither yet dead sarah s womb 4 20 he stagger not promis god unbelief but wa strong faith give glori god 4 21 be fulli persuad that what he had promis he wa abl also perform 4 22 therefor it wa imput him righteous 4 23 now it wa not written hi sake alon that it wa imput him 4 24 but us also whom it shall be imput if we believ him that rais jesu our lord dead 4 25 who wa deliv our offenc wa rais again our justif 5 1 therefor be justifi faith we have peac god our lord jesu christ 5 2 whom also we have access faith thi grace wherein we stand rejoic hope glori god 5 3 not onli so but we glori tribul also know that tribul worketh patienc 5 4 patienc experi experi hope 5 5 hope maketh not asham becaus love god is shed abroad our heart holi ghost which is given unto

world but sin is not imput when there is no law 5 14 nevertheless death reign adam mose even them that had not sin similitud adam s transgress who is figur him that wa come 5 15 but not as offenc so also is free gift if offenc one mani be dead much more grace god gift grace which is one man jesu christ hath abound unto mani 5 16 not as it wa one that sin so is gift judgment wa one condemn but free gift is mani offenc unto justif 5 17 if one man s offenc death reign one much more they which receiv abund grace gift righteous shall reign life one jesu christ 5 18 therefor as offenc one judgment came all men condemn even so righteous one free gift came all men unto justif life 5 19 as one man s disobedi mani were made sinner so obedi one shall mani be made righteou 5 20 moreov law enter that offenc might abound but where sin abound grace did much more abound 5 21 that as sin hath reign unto death even so might grace reign righteous unto etern life jesu christ our lord 6 1 what shall we say then shall we continu sin that grace may abound 6 2 god forbid how shall we that are dead sin live ani longer therein 6 3 know ye not that so mani us as were baptiz jesu christ were

also like hi resurrect 6 6 know thi that our old man is crucifi him that bodi sin might be destroy that henceforth we should not serv sin 6 7 he that is dead is freed sin 6 8 now if we be dead christ we believ that we shall also live him 6 9 know that christ be rais dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion him 6 10 that he die he die unto sin onc but that he liveth he liveth unto god 6 11 likewis reckon ye also yourselv be dead inde unto sin but aliv unto god jesu christ our lord 6 12 let not sin therefor reign your mortal bodi that ye should obey it lust thereof 6 13 neither yield ye your member as instrument unright unto sin but yield yourselv unto god as those that are aliv dead your member as instrument righteous unto god 6 14 sin shall not have dominion you ye are not law but

becaus infirm your flesh as ye have yield your member servant unclean iniqu unto iniqu even so now yield your member servant righteous unto holi 6 20 when ye were servant sin ye were free righteous 6 21 what fruit had ye then those thing whereof ye are now asham end those thing is death 6 22 but now be made free sin becom servant god ye have your fruit unto holi end everlast life 6 23 wage sin is death but gift god is etern life jesu christ our lord 7 1 know ye not brethren i speak them that know law how that law hath dominion man as long as he liveth 7 2 woman which hath husband is bound law her husband so long as he liveth but if husband be dead she is loos law her husband 7 3 so then if while her husband liveth she be marri anoth man she shall be call adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free that law so that she is no adulteress though she be marri anoth man 7 4 wherefor my brethren ye also are becom dead law bodi christ that ye should be marri anoth even him who is rais dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god 7 5 when we were flesh motion sin which were law did work our member bring forth fruit unto death 7 6 but now we are deliv law that be dead wherein we were held that we should serv new spirit not old letter 7 7 what shall we say then is law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but law i had not known lust law had said thou shalt not covet 7 8 but sin take occas command wrought me all manner concupisc law sin wa dead 7 9 i wa aliv law onc but when command came sin reviv i die 7 10 command which wa ordain life i found be unto death 7 11 sin take occas command deceiv me it slew me 7 12 wherefor law is holi command holi just good 7 13 wa then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin work death me that which is good that sin command might becom exceed sin 7 14 we know that law is spiritu but i am carnal sold sin 7 15 that which i do i allow not what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i 7 16 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto law that it is good 7 17 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth me 7 18 i know that me that is my flesh dwelleth no good thing will is present me but how perform that which is good i find not 7 19 good that i would i do not but evil which i would not that i do 7 20 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth me 7 21 i find then law that when i would do good evil is present me 7 22 i delight law god inward man 7 23 but i see anoth law my member war against law my mind bring me captiv law sin which is my member 7 24 o wretch man that i am who shall deliv me bodi thi death 7 25 i thank god jesu christ our lord so then mind i myself serv law god but flesh law sin 8 1 there is therefor now no condemn them which are christ jesu who walk not flesh but spirit 8 2 law spirit life christ jesu hath made me free law sin death 8 3 what law could not do that it wa weak flesh god send hi own son like sin flesh sin condemn sin flesh 8 4 that righteous law might be fulfil us who walk not flesh but spirit 8 5 they that are flesh do mind thing flesh but they that are spirit thing spirit 8 6 be carnal mind is death but be spiritu mind is life peac 8 7 becaus carnal mind is enmiti against god it is not subject law god neither inde can be 8 8 so then they that are flesh cannot pleas god 8 9 but ye are not flesh but spirit if so be that spirit god dwell you now if ani man have not spirit christ he is none hi 8 10 if christ be you bodi is dead becaus sin but spirit is life becaus righteous 8 11 but if spirit him that rais jesu dead dwell you he that rais christ dead shall also quicken your mortal bodi hi spirit that dwelleth you 8 12 therefor brethren we are debtor not flesh live flesh 8 13 if ye live flesh ye shall die but if ye spirit do mortifi deed bodi ye shall live 8 14 as mani as are led spirit god they are son god 8 15 ye have not receiv spirit bondag again fear but ye have

whom he did predestin them he also call whom he call them he also justifi whom he justifi them he also glorifi 8 31 what shall we then say these thing if god be us who can be against us 8 32 he that

flesh these are not children god but children promis are count seed 9 9 thi is word promis thi time will i come sarah shall have son 9 10 not onli thi but when rebecca also had conceiv one even our

13 as it is written jacob have i love but esau have i hate 9 14 what shall we say then is there unright god god forbid 9 15 he saith mose i will have merci whom i will have merci i will have compass whom i will have compass 9 16 so then it is not him that willeth nor him that runneth but god that sheweth merci 9 17 scriptur saith unto pharaoh even thi same purpos have i rais thee that i might shew my power thee that my name might be declar all earth 9 18 therefor hath he merci whom he will have merci whom he will he hardeneth 9 19 thou wilt say then unto me whi doth he yet find fault who

remnant shall be save 9 28 he will finish work cut it short righteous becaus short work will lord make earth 9 29 as esaia said lord sabaoth had left us seed we had been as sodoma been made like unto gomorrha 9 30 what shall we say then that gentil which follow not righteous have attain righteous even righteous which is faith 9 31 but israel which follow law righteous hath not attain law righteous 9 32 wherefor becaus they sought it not faith but as it were work law they stumbl that stumblingston 9 33 as it is written behold i lay sion stumblingston rock offenc whosoev believeth him shall not

word unto end world 10 19 but i say did not israel know first mose saith i will provok you jealousi them that are no peopl foolish nation i will anger you 10 20 but esaia is veri bold saith i wa found them that sought me not i wa made manifest unto them that ask not me 10 21 but israel he saith all day long i have stretch forth my hand unto disobedi gainsay peopl 11 1 i say then hath god cast away

that your bodi is templ holi ghost which is you which ye have god ye are not your own 6 20 ye are bought price therefor glorifi god your bodi your spirit which are god s 7 1 now concern thing whereof ye wrote unto me it is good man not touch woman 7 2 nevertheless avoid fornic let everi man have hi own wife let everi woman have her own husband 7 3 let husband render unto wife due benevol likewis also wife unto husband 7 4 wife hath not power her own bodi but husband likewis also husband hath not power hi own bodi but wife 7 5 defraud ye not one other it be consent time that ye may give yourselv fast prayer come togeth again that satan tempt you not your incontin 7 6 but i speak thi permiss not command 7 7 i would that all men were even as i myself but everi man hath hi proper gift god one thi manner anoth that 7 8 i say therefor unmarri widow it is good them if they abid even as i 7 9 but if they cannot contain let them marri it is better marri than burn 7 10 unto marri i command yet not i but lord let not wife depart her husband 7 11 but if she depart let her remain unmarri or be reconcil her husband let not husband put away hi wife 7 12 but rest speak i not lord if ani brother hath wife that believeth not she be pleas dwell him let him not put her away 7 13 woman which hath husband that believeth not if he be pleas dwell her let her not leav him 7 14 unbeliev husband is sanctifi wife unbeliev wife is sanctifi husband els were your children unclean but now are they holi 7 15 but if unbeliev depart let him depart brother or sister is not bondag such case but god hath call us peac 7 16 what knowest thou o wife thou shalt save thi husband or how knowest thou o man thou shalt save thi wife 7 17 but as god hath distribut everi man as lord hath call everi one so let him walk so ordain i all church 7 18 is ani man call be circumcis let him not becom uncircumcis is ani call uncircumcis let him not be circumcis 7 19 circumcis is noth uncircumcis is noth but keep command god 7 20 let everi man abid same call wherein he wa call 7 21 art thou call be servant care not it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather 7 22 he that is call lord be servant is lord s freeman likewis also he that is call be free is christ s servant 7 23 ye are bought price be not ye servant men 7 24 brethren let everi man wherein he is call therein abid god 7 25 now concern virgin i have no command lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtain merci lord be faith 7 26 i suppos therefor that thi is good present distress i say that it is good man so be 7 27 art thou bound unto wife seek not be loos art thou loos wife seek not wife 7 28 but if thou marri thou hast not sin if virgin marri she hath not sin nevertheless such shall have troubl flesh but i spare you 7 29 but thi i say brethren time is short it remaineth that both they that have wive be as though they had none 7 30 they that weep as though they wept not they that rejoic as though they rejoic not they that buy as though they possess not 7 31 they that use thi world as not abus it fashion thi world passeth away 7 32 but i would have you care he that is unmarri careth thing that belong lord how he may pleas lord 7 33 but he that is marri careth thing that are world how he may pleas hi wife 7 34 there is differ also wife virgin unmarri woman careth thing lord that she may be holi both bodi spirit but she that is marri careth thing world how she may pleas her husband 7 35 thi i speak your own profit not that i may cast snare you but that which is come that ye may attend lord distract 7 36 but if ani man think that he behaveth himself uncom hi virgin if she pass flower her age need so requir let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marri 7 37 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast hi heart have no necess but hath power hi own will hath so decre hi heart that he will keep hi virgin doeth well 7 38 so then he that giveth her marriag doeth well but he that giveth her not marriag doeth better 7 39 wife is bound law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is liberti be marri whom she will onli lord 7 40 but she is happier if she so abid my judgment i think also that i have spirit god 8 1 now as touch thing offer unto idol we know that we all have knowledg knowledg puffeth but chariti edifieth 8 2 if ani man think that he knoweth ani thing he knoweth noth yet as he ought know 8 3 but if ani man love god same is known him 8 4 as concern therefor eat those thing that are offer sacrific unto idol we know that idol is noth world that there is none other god but one 8 5 though there be that are call god heaven or earth as there be god mani lord mani 8 6 but us there is but one god father whom are all thing we him one lord jesu christ whom are all thing we him 8 7 howbeit there is not everi man that knowledg some conscienc idol unto thi hour eat it as thing offer unto idol their conscienc be weak is defil 8 8 but meat commendeth us not god neither if we eat are we better neither if we eat not are we wors 8 9 but take heed lest ani mean thi liberti your becom stumblingblock them that are weak 8 10 if ani man see thee which hast knowledg sit meat idol s templ shall not conscienc him which is weak be embolden eat those thing which are offer idol 8 11 thi knowledg shall weak brother perish whom christ die 8 12 but when ye sin so against brethren wound their weak conscienc ye sin against christ 8 13 wherefor if meat make my brother offend i will eat no flesh while world standeth lest i make my brother offend 9 1 am i not apostl am i not free have i not seen jesu christ our lord are not ye my work lord 9 2 if i be not apostl unto other yet doubtless i am you seal mine apostleship are ye lord 9 3 mine answer them that do examin me is thi 9 4 have we not power eat drink 9 5 have we not power lead sister wife as well as other apostl as brethren lord cepha 9 6 or i onli barnaba have not we power forbear work 9 7 who goeth warfar ani time hi own charg who planteth vineyard eateth not fruit thereof or who feedeth flock eateth not milk flock 9 8 say i these thing as man or saith not law same also 9 9 it is written law mose thou shalt not muzzl mouth ox that treadeth corn doth god take care oxen 9 10 or saith he it altogeth our sake our sake no doubt thi is written that he that ploweth should plow hope that he that thresheth hope should be partak hi hope 9 11 if we have sown unto you spiritu thing is it great thing if we shall reap your carnal thing 9 12 if other be partak thi power you are not we rather nevertheless we have not use thi power but suffer all thing lest we should hinder gospel christ 9 13 do ye not know that they which minist holi thing live thing templ they which wait altar are partak altar 9 14 even so hath lord ordain that they which preach gospel should live gospel 9 15 but i have use none these thing neither have i written these thing that it should be so done unto me it were better me die than that ani man should make my glori void 9 16 though i preach gospel i have noth glori necess is laid me yea woe is unto me if i preach not gospel 9 17 if i do thi thing willingli i have reward but if against my will dispens gospel is commit unto me 9 18 what is my reward then verili that when i preach gospel i may make gospel christ charg that i abus not my power gospel 9 19 though i be free all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain more 9 20 unto jew i becam as jew that i might gain jew them that are law as law that i might gain them that are law 9 21 them that are law as law be not law god but law christ that i might gain them that are law 9 22 weak becam i as weak that i might gain weak i am made all thing all men that i might all mean save some 9 23 thi i do gospel s sake that i might be partak thereof you 9 24 know ye not that they which run race run all but one receiveth prize so run that ye may obtain 9 25 everi man that striveth masteri is temper all thing now they do it obtain corrupt crown but we incorrupt 9 26 i therefor so run not as uncertainli so fight i not as one that beateth air 9 27 but i keep my bodi bring it subject lest that ani mean when i have preach other i myself should be castaway 10 1 moreov brethren i would not that ye should be ignor how that all our father were cloud all pass sea 10 2 were all baptiz unto mose cloud sea 10 3 did all eat same spiritu meat 10 4 did all drink same spiritu drink they drank that spiritu rock that follow them that rock wa christ 10 5 but mani them god wa not well pleas they were overthrown wilder 10 6 now these thing were our exampl intent we should not lust evil thing as they also lust 10 7 neither be ye idolat as were some them as it is written peopl sat down eat drink rose play 10 8 neither let us commit fornic as some them commit fell one day three twenti thousand 10 9 neither let us tempt christ as some them also tempt were destroy serpent 10 10 neither murmur ye as some them also murmur were destroy destroy 10 11 now all these thing happen unto them ensampl they are written our admonit whom end world are come 10 12 wherefor let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall 10 13 there hath no temptat taken you but such as is common man but god is faith who will not suffer you be tempt that ye are abl but will temptat also make way escap that ye may be abl bear it 10 14 wherefor my dearli belov flee idolatri 10 15 i speak as wise men judg ye what i say 10 16 cup bless which we bless is it not communion blood christ bread which we break is it not communion bodi christ 10 17 we be mani are one bread one bodi we are all partak that one bread 10 18 behold israel flesh are not they which eat sacrific partak altar 10 19 what say i then that idol is ani thing or that which is offer sacrific idol is ani thing 10 20 but i say that thing which gentil sacrific they sacrific devil not god i would not that ye should have fellowship devil 10 21 ye cannot drink cup lord cup devil ye cannot be partak lord s tabl tabl devil 10 22 do we provok lord jealousi are we stronger than he 10 23 all thing are law me but all thing are not expedi all thing are law me but all thing edifi not 10 24 let no man seek hi own but everi man anoth s wealth 10 25 whatsoev is sold shambl that eat ask no question conscienc sake 10 26 earth is lord s ful thereof 10 27 if ani them that believ not bid you feast ye be dispos go whatsoev is set you eat ask no question conscienc sake 10 28 but if ani man say unto you thi is offer sacrific unto idol eat not hi sake that shew it conscienc sake earth is lord s ful thereof 10 29 conscienc i say not thine own but other whi is my liberti judg anoth man s conscienc 10 30 if i grace be partak whi am i evil spoken that which i give thank 10 31 therefor ye eat or drink or whatsoev ye do do all glori god 10 32 give none offenc neither jew nor gentil nor church god 10 33 even as i pleas all men all thing not seek mine own profit but profit mani that they may be save 11 1 be ye follow me even as i also am christ 11 2 now i prais you brethren that ye rememb me all thing keep ordin as i deliv them you 11 3 but i would have you know that head everi man is christ head woman is man head christ is god 11 4 everi man pray or prophesi have hi head cover dishonoureth hi head 11 5 but everi woman that prayeth or prophesieth her head uncov dishonoureth her head that is even all one as if she were shaven 11 6 if woman be not cover let her also be shorn but if it be shame woman be shorn or shaven let her be cover 11 7 man inde ought not cover hi head forasmuch as he is imag glori god but woman is glori man 11 8 man is not woman but woman man 11 9 neither wa man creat woman but woman man 11 10 thi caus ought woman have power her head becaus angel 11 11 nevertheless neither is man woman neither woman man lord 11 12 as woman is man even so is man also woman but all thing god 11 13 judg yourselv is it come that woman pray unto god uncov 11 14 doth not even natur itself teach you that if man have long hair it is shame unto him 11 15 but if woman have long hair it is glori her her hair is given her cover 11 16 but if ani man seem be contenti we have no such custom neither church god 11 17 now thi that i declar unto you i prais you not that ye come togeth not better but wors 11 18 first all when ye come togeth church i hear that there be divis you i partli believ it 11 19 there must be also heresi you that they which are approv may be made manifest you 11 20 when ye come togeth therefor one place thi is not eat lord s supper 11 21 eat everi one taketh other hi own supper one is hungri anoth is drunken 11 22 what have ye not hous eat drink or despis ye church god shame them that have not what shall i say you shall i prais you thi i prais you not 11 23 i have receiv lord that which also i deliv unto you that lord jesu same night which he wa betray took bread 11 24 when he had given thank he brake it said take eat thi is my bodi which is broken you thi do remembr me 11 25 same manner also he took cup when he had sup say thi cup is new testament my blood thi do ye as oft as ye drink it remembr me 11 26 as often as ye eat thi bread drink thi cup ye do shew lord s death till he come 11 27 wherefor whosoev shall eat thi bread drink thi cup lord unworthili shall be guilti bodi blood lord 11 28 but let man examin himself so let him eat that bread drink that cup 11 29 he that eateth drinketh unworthili eateth drinketh damnat himself not discern lord s bodi 11 30 thi caus mani are weak sickli you mani sleep 11 31 if we would judg ourselv we should not be judg 11 32 but when we are judg we are chasten lord that we should not be condemn world 11 33 wherefor my brethren when ye come togeth eat tarri one anoth 11 34 if ani man hunger let him eat home that ye come not togeth unto condemn rest will i set order when i come 12 1 now concern spiritu gift brethren i would not have you ignor 12 2 ye know that ye were gentil carri away unto these dumb idol even as ye were led 12 3 wherefor i give you understand that no man speak spirit god calleth jesu accurs that no man can say that jesu is lord but holi ghost 12 4 now there are divers gift but same spirit 12 5 there are differ administr but same lord 12 6 there are divers oper but it is same god which worketh all all 12 7 but manifest spirit is given everi man profit withal 12 8 one is given spirit word wisdom anoth word knowledg same spirit 12 9 anoth faith same spirit anoth gift heal same spirit 12 10 anoth work miracl anoth propheci anoth discern spirit anoth diver kind tongu anoth interpret tongu 12 11 but all these worketh that one selfsam spirit divid everi man sever as he will 12 12 as bodi is one hath mani member all member that one bodi be mani are one bodi so also is christ 12 13 one spirit are we all baptiz one bodi we be jew or gentil we be bond or free have been all made drink one spirit 12 14 bodi is not one member but mani 12 15 if foot shall say becaus i am not hand i am not bodi is it therefor not bodi 12 16 if ear shall say becaus i am not eye i am not bodi is it therefor not bodi 12 17 if whole bodi were eye where were hear if whole were hear where were smell 12 18 but now hath god set member everi one them bodi as it hath pleas him 12 19 if they were all one member where were bodi 12 20 but now are they mani member yet but one bodi 12 21 eye cannot say unto hand i have no need thee nor again head feet i have no need you 12 22 nay much more those member bodi which seem be more feebl are necessari 12 23 those member bodi which we think be less honour these we bestow more abund honour our uncom part have more abund comeli 12 24 our come part have no need but god hath temper bodi togeth have given more abund honour that part which lack 12 25 that there should be no schism bodi but that member should have same care one anoth 12 26 one member suffer all member suffer it or one member be honour all member rejoic it 12 27 now ye are bodi christ member particular 12 28 god hath set some church first apostl secondarili prophet thirdli teacher that miracl then gift heal help govern divers tongu 12 29 are all apostl are all prophet are all teacher are all worker miracl 12 30 have all gift heal do all speak tongu do all interpret 12 31 but covet earnestli best gift yet shew i unto you more excel way 13 1 though i speak tongu men angel have not chariti i am becom as sound brass or tinkl cymbal 13 2 though i have gift propheci understand all mysteri all knowledg though i have all faith so that i could remov mountain have not chariti i am noth 13 3 though i bestow all my good feed poor though i give my bodi be burn have not chariti it profiteth me noth 13 4 chariti suffereth long is kind chariti envieth not chariti vaunteth not itself is not puf 13 5 doth not behav itself unseemli seeketh not her own is not easili provok thinketh no evil 13 6 rejoiceth not iniqu but rejoiceth truth 13 7 beareth all thing believeth all thing hopeth all thing endureth all thing 13 8 chariti never faileth but there be propheci they shall fail there be tongu they shall ceas there be knowledg it shall vanish away 13 9 we know part we prophesi part 13 10 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is part shall be done away 13 11 when i wa child i spake as child i understood as child i thought as child but when i becam man i put away childish thing 13 12 now we see glass darkli but then face face now i know part but then shall i know even as also i am known 13 13 now abideth faith hope chariti these three but greatest these is chariti 14 1 follow chariti desir spiritu gift but rather that ye may prophesi 14 2 he that speaketh unknown tongu speaketh not unto men but unto god no man understandeth him howbeit spirit he speaketh mysteri 14 3 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edif exhort comfort 14 4 he that speaketh unknown tongu edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth church 14 5 i would that ye all spake tongu but rather that ye prophesi greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh tongu he interpret that church may receiv edifi 14 6 now brethren if i come unto you speak tongu what shall i profit you i shall speak you either revel or knowledg or prophesi or doctrin 14 7 even thing life give sound pipe or harp they give distinct sound how shall it be known what is pipe or harp 14 8 if trumpet give uncertain sound who shall prepar himself battl 14 9 so likewis ye ye utter tongu word easi be understood how shall it be known what is spoken ye shall speak air 14 10 there are it may be so mani kind voic world none them is signif 14 11 therefor if i know not mean voic i shall be unto him that speaketh barbarian he that speaketh shall be barbarian unto me 14 12 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealou spiritu gift seek that ye may excel edifi church 14 13 wherefor let him that speaketh unknown tongu pray that he may interpret 14 14 if i pray unknown tongu my spirit prayeth but my understand is unfruit 14 15 what is it then i will pray spirit i will pray understand also i will sing spirit i will sing understand also 14 16 els when thou shalt bless spirit how shall he that occupieth room unlearn say amen thi give thank see he understandeth not what thou sayest 14 17 thou verili givest thank well but other is not edifi 14 18 i thank my god i speak tongu more than ye all 14 19 yet church i had rather speak five word my understand that my voic i might teach other also than ten thousand word unknown tongu 14 20 brethren be not children understand howbeit malic be ye children but understand be men 14 21 law it is written men other tongu other lip will i speak unto thi peopl yet all that will they not hear me saith lord 14 22 wherefor tongu are sign not them that believ but them that believ not but prophesi serveth not them that believ not but them which believ 14 23 if therefor whole church be come togeth one place all speak tongu there come those that are unlearn or unbeliev will they not say that ye are mad 14 24 but if all prophesi there come one that believeth not or one unlearn he is convinc all he is judg all 14 25 thu are secret hi heart made manifest so fall down hi face he will worship god report that god is you truth 14 26 how is it then brethren when ye come togeth everi one you hath psalm hath doctrin hath tongu hath revel hath interpret let all thing be done unto edifi 14 27 if ani man speak unknown tongu let it be two or most three that cours let one interpret 14 28 but if there be no interpret let him keep silenc church let him speak himself god 14 29 let prophet speak two or three let other judg 14 30 if ani thing be reveal anoth that sitteth let first hold hi peac 14 31 ye may all prophesi one one that all may learn all may be comfort 14 32 spirit prophet are subject prophet 14 33 god is not author confus but peac as all church saint 14 34 let your women keep silenc church it is not permit unto them speak but they are command be obedi as also saith law 14 35 if they will learn ani thing let them ask their husband home it is shame women speak church 14 36 what came word god you or came it unto you onli 14 37 if ani man think himself be prophet or spiritu let him acknowledg that thing that i write unto you are command lord 14 38 but if ani man be ignor let him be ignor 14 39 wherefor brethren covet prophesi forbid not speak tongu 14 40 let all thing be done decent order 15 1 moreov brethren i declar unto you gospel which i preach unto you which also ye have receiv wherein ye stand 15 2 which also ye are save if ye keep memori what i preach unto you unless ye have believ vain 15 3 i deliv unto you first all that which i also receiv how that christ die our sin accord scriptur 15 4 that he wa buri that he rose again third day accord scriptur 15 5 that he wa seen cepha then twelv 15 6 that he wa seen five hundr brethren onc whom greater part remain unto thi present but some are fallen asleep 15 7 that he wa seen jame then all apostl 15 8 last all he wa seen me also as one born due time 15 9 i am least apostl that am not meet be call apostl becaus i persecut church god 15 10 but grace god i am what i am hi grace which wa bestow me wa not vain but i labour more abundantli than they all yet not i but grace god which wa me 15 11 therefor it were i or they so we preach so ye believ 15 12 now if christ be preach that he rose dead how say some you that there is no resurrect dead 15 13 but if there be no resurrect dead then is christ not risen 15 14 if christ be not risen then is our preach vain your faith is also vain 15 15 yea we are found fals wit god becaus we have testifi god that he rais christ

christ s gospel door wa open unto me lord 2 13 i had no rest my spirit becaus i found not titu my brother but take my leav them i went thenc macedonia 2 14 now thank be unto god which alway causeth us triumph christ maketh manifest savour hi knowledg us everi place 2 15 we are unto god sweet savour christ them that are save them that perish 2 16 one we are savour death unto death other savour life unto life who is suffici these thing 2 17 we are not as mani which corrupt word god but as sincer but as god sight god speak we christ 3 1 do we begin again commend ourselv or need we as some other epistl commend you or letter commend you 3 2 ye are our epistl written our heart known read all men 3 3 forasmuch as ye are manifestli declar be epistl christ minist us written not ink but spirit live god not tabl stone but fleshi tabl heart 3 4 such trust have we christ god ward 3 5 not that we are suffici ourselv think ani thing as ourselv but our suffici is god 3 6 who also hath made us abl minist new testament not letter but spirit letter killeth but spirit giveth life 3 7 but if ministr death written engraven stone wa gloriou so that children israel could not stedfastli behold face mose glori hi counten which glori wa be done away 3 8 how shall not ministr spirit be rather gloriou 3 9 if ministr condemn be glori much more doth ministr righteous exceed glori 3 10 even that which wa made gloriou had no glori thi respect reason glori that excelleth 3 11 if that which is done away wa gloriou much more that which remaineth is gloriou 3 12 see then that we have such hope we use great plain speech 3 13 not as mose which put vail hi face that children israel could not stedfastli look end that which is abolish 3 14 but their mind were blind thi day remaineth same vail untaken away read old testament which vail is done away christ 3 15 but even unto thi day when mose is read vail is their heart 3 16 nevertheless when it shall turn lord vail shall be taken away 3 17 now lord is that spirit where spirit lord is there is liberti 3 18 but we all open face behold as glass glori lord are chang same imag glori glori even as spirit lord 4 1 therefor see we have thi ministri as we have receiv merci we faint not 4 2 but have renounc hidden thing dishonesti not walk crafti nor handl word god deceit but manifest truth commend ourselv everi man s conscienc sight god 4 3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid them that are lost 4 4 whom god thi world hath blind mind them which believ not lest light gloriou gospel christ who is imag god should shine unto them 4 5 we preach not ourselv but christ jesu lord ourselv your servant jesu sake 4 6 god who command light shine dark hath shine our heart give light knowledg glori god face jesu christ 4 7 but we have thi treasur earthen vessel that excel power may be god not us 4 8 we are troubl everi side yet not distress we are perplex but not despair 4 9 persecut but not forsaken cast down but not destroy 4 10 alway bear bodi die lord jesu that life also jesu might be made manifest our bodi 4 11 we which live are alway deliv unto death jesu sake that life also jesu might be made manifest our mortal flesh 4 12 so then death worketh us but life you 4 13 we have same spirit faith accord as it is written i believ therefor have i spoken we also believ therefor speak 4 14 know that he which rais lord jesu shall rais us also jesu shall present us you 4 15 all thing are your sake that abund grace might thanksgiv mani redound glori god 4 16 which caus we faint not but though our outward man perish yet inward man is renew day day 4 17 our light afflict which is but moment worketh us far more exceed etern weight glori 4 18 while we look not thing which are seen but thing which are not seen thing which are seen are tempor but thing which are not seen are etern 5 1 we know that if our earthli hous thi tabernacl were dissolv we have build god hous not made hand etern heaven 5 2 thi we groan earnestli desir be cloth our hous which is heaven 5 3 if so be that be cloth we shall not be found nake 5 4 we that are thi tabernacl do groan be burden not that we would be uncloth but cloth that mortal might be swallow life 5 5 now he that hath wrought us selfsam thing is god who also hath given unto us earnest spirit 5 6 therefor we are alway confid know that whilst we are home bodi we are absent lord 5 7 we walk faith not sight 5 8 we are confid i say will rather be absent bodi be present lord 5 9 wherefor we labour that present or absent we may be accept him 5 10 we must all appear judgment seat christ that everi one may receiv thing done hi bodi accord that he hath done it be good or bad 5 11 know therefor terror lord we persuad men but we are made manifest unto god i trust also are made manifest your conscienc 5 12 we commend not ourselv again unto you but give you occas glori our behalf that ye may have somewhat answer them which glori appear not heart 5 13 we be besid ourselv it is god or we be sober it is your caus 5 14 love christ constraineth us becaus we thu judg that if one die all then were all dead 5 15 that he die all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselv but unto him which die them rose again 5 16 wherefor henceforth know we no man flesh yea though we have known christ flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more 5 17 therefor if ani man be christ he is new creatur old thing are pass away behold all thing are becom new 5 18 all thing are god who hath reconcil us himself jesu christ hath given us ministri reconcili 5 19 wit that god wa christ reconcil world unto himself not imput their trespass unto them hath commit unto us word reconcili 5 20 now then we are ambassador christ as though god did beseech you us we pray you christ s
