have controvert one or two idea that are almost univers accept geometri instanc they taught you school is found misconcept is not that rather larg thing expect us begin said filbi argument person red hair i do not mean ask you accept anyth reason ground it you will soon admit as much as i need you you know cours that mathemat line line thick _nil_ ha no real exist they taught you that neither ha mathemat plane these thing are mere abstract that is all right said psychologist nor have onli length breadth thick can cube have real exist there i object said filbi cours solid bodi may exist all real thing so most peopl think but wait moment can _instantaneous_ cube exist don t follow you said filbi can cube that doe not last ani time all have real exist filbi becam pensiv clearli time travel proceed ani real bodi must have extens _four_ direct it must have length breadth thick durat but natur infirm flesh which i will explain you moment we inclin overlook thi fact there are realli four dimens three which we call three plane space fourth time there is howev tendenc draw unreal distinct former three dimens latter becaus it happen that our conscious move intermitt one direct latter begin end our live that said veri young man make spasmod effort relight hi cigar lamp that veri clear inde now it is veri remark that thi is so extens overlook continu time travel slight access cheer realli thi is what is meant fourth dimens though some peopl who talk fourth dimens do not know they mean it it is onli anoth way look time _there is no differ time ani three dimens space that our conscious move it_ but some foolish peopl have got hold wrong side that idea you have all heard what they have say thi fourth dimens _i_ have not said provinci mayor it is simpli thi that space as our mathematician have it is spoken as have three dimens which one may call length breadth thick is alway defin refer three plane each right angl other but some philosoph peopl have been ask whi _three_ dimens particularli whi not anoth direct right angl other three have even tri construct four dimension geometri professor simon newcomb wa expound thi new york mathemat societi onli month or so ago you know how flat surfac which ha onli two dimens we can repres figur three dimension solid similarli they think that model three dimens they could repres one four if they could master perspect thing see i think so murmur provinci mayor knit hi brow he laps introspect state hi lip move as one who repeat mystic word ye i think i see it now he said some time brighten quit transitori manner well i do not mind tell you i have been work thi geometri four dimens some time some my result are curiou instanc here is portrait man eight year old anoth fifteen anoth seventeen anoth twenti three so all these are evid section as it were three dimension represent hi four dimens be which is fix unalter thing scientif peopl proceed time travel paus requir proper assimil thi know veri well that time is onli kind space here is popular scientif diagram weather record thi line i trace my finger show movement baromet yesterday it wa so high yesterday night it fell then thi morn it rose again so gentli upward here sure mercuri did not trace thi line ani dimens space gener recognis but certainli it trace such line that line therefor we must conclud wa time dimens but said medic man stare hard coal fire if time is realli onli fourth dimens space whi is it whi ha it alway been regard as someth differ whi cannot we move time as we move other dimens space time travel smile are you so sure we can move freeli space right left we can go backward forward freeli enough men alway have done so i admit we move freeli two dimens but how down gravit limit us there not exactli said medic man there are balloon but balloon save spasmod jump inequ surfac man had no freedom vertic movement still they could move littl down said medic man easier far easier down than you cannot move all time you cannot get away present moment my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where whole world ha gone wrong we are alway get away present moment our mental exist which are immateri have no dimens are pass time dimens uniform veloc cradl grave just as we should travel _down_ if we began our exist fifti mile earth s surfac but great difficulti is thi interrupt psychologist you _can_ move all direct space but you cannot move time that is germ my great discoveri but you are wrong say that we cannot move time instanc if i am recal incid veri vividli i go back instant it occurr i becom absent mind as you say i jump back moment cours we have no mean stay back ani length time ani more than savag or anim ha stay six feet ground but civilis man is better off than savag thi respect he can go against gravit balloon whi should he not hope that ultim he may be abl stop or acceler hi drift time dimens or even turn travel other way oh _this_ began filbi is all whi not said time travel it s against reason said filbi what reason said time travel you can show black is white argument said filbi but you will never convinc me possibl not said time travel but now you begin see object my
