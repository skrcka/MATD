saw my dream that christian ask him further if he could not help him off hi burden that wa hi back as yet he had not got rid thereof nor could he ani mean get it off help he told him as thi burden be content bear it thou comest place deliver there it will fall thi back itself 69 then christian began gird hi loin address himself hi journey so other told him that that he wa gone some distanc gate he

excel thing such as would be help me my journey 72 inter then said interpret come i will show that which will be profit thee so he command hi man light candl bid christian follow him so he had him privat room bid hi man open door which when he had done christian saw pictur veri grave person hang against wall thi wa fashion it it had eye lift heaven best book hi hand law truth wa written hi lip world wa behind hi back it stood as if it plead men crown gold did hang hi head chr then said christian what meaneth thi 73 inter man whose pictur thi is is one thousand he can beget children 1 cor 4

place whither thou art go hath authoris be thi guid all difficult place thou mayest meet way wherefor take good heed what i have shew thee bear well thi mind what thou hast seen lest thi journey thou meet some that pretend lead thee right but their way goe down death 74 then he took him hand led him veri larg parlour that wa full dust becaus never swept which he had review littl while interpret call man sweep now when he began sweep dust began so abundantli fli that christian had almost therewith been choke then said interpret damsel that stood bring hither water sprinkl room which when she had done it wa swept cleans pleasur 75 chr then said christian what mean thi inter interpret answer thi parlour is heart man that wa never sanctifi sweet grace gospel dust is hi origin sin inward corrupt that have defil whole man he that began sweep first is law but she that brought water did sprinkl it is gospel now wherea thou sawest that so soon as first began sweep dust did so fli that room him could not be cleans but that thou wast almost choke therewith thi is shew thee that law instead cleans heart it work sin doth reviv put strength increas it soul even as it doth discov forbid it it doth not give power subdu rom 7 6 1 cor 15 56 rom 5 20 76 again as thou sawest damsel sprinkl room water which it wa cleans pleasur thi is show thee that when gospel come sweet preciou influenc

26 john 15 13 77 i saw moreov my dream that interpret took him hand had him littl room where sat two littl children each one hi chair name eldest wa passion name other patienc passion seem be much discont but patienc wa veri quiet then christian ask what is reason discont passion interpret answer governor them would have him stay hi best thing till begin next year but he will have all now but patienc is will wait then i saw that one came passion brought him bag treasur pour it down hi feet which he took rejoic therein withal laugh patienc scorn but i beheld but while he had lavish all away had noth left him but rag 78 chr then said christian interpret expound thi matter more fulli me inter so he said these two lad are figur passion men thi world patienc men that which is come as here thou seest passion will have all now thi year that is say thi world so are men thi world they must have all their good thing now they cannot stay till next year that is next world their portion good that proverb bird hand is worth two bush is more author them than are all divin testimoni good world come but as thou sawest that he had quickli lavish all away had present left him noth but rag so will it be all such men end thi world chr then said christian now i see that patienc ha best wisdom that mani account first becaus he stay best thing second also becaus he will have glori hi when other ha noth but rag 79 inter nay you may add anoth wit glori next world will never wear but these are suddenli gone therefor passion had not so much reason laugh patienc becaus he had hi good thing first as patienc will have laugh passion becaus he had hi best thing last first must give place last becaus last must have hi time come but last give place noth there is not anoth succeed he therefor that hath hi portion first must need have time spend it but he that hath hi portion last must have it lastingli therefor it is said dive thou thi life time receivedst thi good thing likewis lazaru

drive down all him but so soon as faith talk heart work like moon that s past full wane he goe so will all but he that heart work know 208 thu they went talk what they had seen way so made that way easi which would otherwis no doubt have been tediou them now they went wilder 209 now when they were got almost quit thi wilder faith chanc cast hi eye back espi one come them he knew him oh said

rest way rather that they well knew that he wa prophet could tell them thing that might happen unto them also how they might resist overcom them which request faith also consent so evangelist began as followeth evan my son you have heard word truth gospel that you must mani tribul enter kingdom heaven again that everi citi bond afflict abid you therefor you cannot expect that you should go long your pilgrimag them some sort or other you have found someth truth these testimoni you alreadi more will immedi follow now as you see you are almost thi wilder therefor you will soon come town that you will see you that town you will be hardli beset enemi who will strain hard but they will kill you be you sure that one or both you must seal testimoni which you hold blood but be you faith unto

commit keep your soul your god well do as unto faith creator 215 then i saw my dream that when they were got wilder they present saw town them name that town is vaniti town there is fair kept call vaniti fair it is kept all year long it beareth name vaniti fair becaus town where it is kept is lighter than vaniti also becaus all that is there sold or that cometh thither is vaniti as is say wise all that cometh is vaniti eccl 1 2 11 17 11 8 isa 11 17 216 thi fair is no new erect busi but thing ancient stand i will show you origin it almost five thousand year agon there were pilgrim walk celesti citi as these two honest person are beelzebub apollyon legion their companion perceiv path that pilgrim made that their way citi lay thi town vaniti they contriv here set fair fair wherein should be sold all sort vaniti that it should last all year long therefor thi fair are all such merchandis sold as hous land trade place honour prefer titl countri kingdom lust pleasur delight all

sever sort vaniti are be sold but as other fair some one commod is as chief all fair so ware rome her merchandis is greatli promot thi fair onli our english nation some other have taken dislik thereat 218 now as i said way celesti citi lie just thi town where thi lusti fair is kept he that will go citi yet not go thi town must need go world 1 cor 5 10 princ princ himself when here went thi town hi own countri that fair day too yea as i think it wa beelzebub chief lord thi fair that invit him buy hi vaniti yea would have made him lord fair would he but have done him rever as he went town matt 4 8 luke 4 5 7 yea becaus he wa such person honour beelzebub had him street street show him all kingdom world littl time that he might if possibl allur bless one cheapen buy some hi vaniti but he had no mind merchandis therefor left town lay so much as one farth these vaniti thi fair therefor is ancient thing long stand veri great fair 219 now these pilgrim as i said must need go thi fair well so they did but behold even as they enter fair all peopl fair were move town itself as it were hubbub them that sever reason 220 first pilgrim were cloth such kind raiment as wa divers raiment ani that trade that fair peopl therefor fair made great gaze them some said they were fool some they were bedlam some they are outlandish men 1 cor 2 7 8 221 secondli as they wonder their apparel so they did likewis their speech few could understand what they said they natur spoke languag canaan but they that kept fair were men thi world so that one end fair other they seem barbarian each other 222 thirdli but that which did not littl amus merchandis wa that these pilgrim set veri light all their ware they care not so much as look them if they call them buy they would put their finger their ear cri turn away mine eye behold vaniti look upward signifi that their trade traffic wa heaven ps 119 37 phil 3 19 20 223 one chanc mockingli behold carriag men say unto them what will ye buy but they look grave him answer we buy truth prov 23 23 that there wa occas taken despis men more some mock some taunt some speak reproach some call other smite them last thing came hubbub great stir fair insomuch that all order wa confound now wa word present brought great one fair who quickli came down deput some hi most trusti friend take these men examin whom fair wa almost overturn so men were brought examin they that sat them ask them whenc they came whither they went what they did there such unusu garb men told them that they were pilgrim stranger world that they were go their own countri which wa heavenli jerusalem heb 11 13 16 that they had given no occas men town nor yet merchandis thu abus them let them their journey it wa that when one ask them what they would buy they said they would buy truth but they that were appoint examin them did not believ them be ani other than bedlam mad or els such as came put all thing confus fair therefor they took them beat them besmear them dirt then put them cage that they might be made spectacl all men fair behold vaniti fair pilgrim there are chain d stand besid even so it wa our lord pass d here mount calvari die 224 there therefor they lay some time were made object ani man s sport or malic or reveng great one fair laugh still all that befel them but men be patient not render rail rail but contrariwis bless good word bad kind injuri done some men fair that were more observ less prejud than rest began check blame baser sort their continu abus done them men they therefor angri manner let fli them again count them as bad as

did harm one anoth then were these two poor men brought their examin again there charg as be guilti late hubbub that had been fair so they beat them piti hang iron them led them chain down fair exampl terror other lest ani should speak their behalf or join themselv unto them but christian faith behav themselv yet more wise receiv ignomini shame that wa cast them so much meek patienc that it won their side though but few comparison rest sever men fair thi put other parti yet greater rage insomuch that they conclud death these two men wherefor they threaten that cage nor iron should serv their turn but that they should die abus they had done delud men fair then were they remand cage again further order should be taken them so they put them made their feet fast stock 225 here therefor they call again mind what they had heard their faith friend evangelist were more confirm their way suffer what he told them would happen them they also now comfort each other that whose lot it wa suffer even he should have best it therefor each man secretli wish that he might have that prefer but commit themselv all wise dispos him that ruleth all thing much content they abod condit which they were they should be otherwis dispos 226 then conveni time be appoint they brought them forth their trial order their condemn when time wa come they were brought their enemi arraign judg s name wa lord hate

scriptur nor reason you see we have both our side neither know hi own liberti nor seek hi own safeti 253 end my brethren we are as you see go all pilgrimag our better divers thing that are bad give me leav propound unto you thi question suppos man minist or tradesman c should have advantag lie him get good bless thi life yet so as that he can no mean come them appear least he becom extraordinarili zealou some point religion that he meddl not may he not use these mean attain hi end yet be right honest man 254 money love i see bottom your question these gentlemen s good leav i will endeavour shape you answer first speak your question as it concern minist himself suppos minist worthi man possess but veri small benefic ha hi eye greater more fat plump far he ha also now opportun get it yet so as be more studiou preach more frequent zealous becaus temper peopl requir it alter some hi principl my part i see no reason but man may do thi provid he ha call ay more great deal besid yet be honest man whi 255 1 hi desir greater benefic is law thi cannot be contradict it is set him provid so then he may get it if he can make no question conscienc sake 256 2 besid hi desir that benefic make him more studiou more zealou preacher c so make him better man yea make him better improv hi part which is accord mind god 257 3 now as hi compli temper hi peopl dissent serv them some hi principl thi argueth 1 that he is self deni temper 2 sweet win deport so 3 more fit ministeri function 258 4 i conclud then that minist that chang small great should not so do be judg as covet but rather he ha improv hi part industri therebi be count as one that pursu hi call opportun put hi hand do good 259 now second part question which concern tradesman you mention suppos such one have but poor employ world but becom religi he may mend hi market perhap get rich wife or more far better custom hi shop my part i see no reason but that thi may be law done whi 1 becom religi is virtu what mean soever man becom so 2 nor is it unlaw get rich wife or more custom my shop 3 besid man that get these becom religi get that which is good them that are good becom good himself so then here is good wife good custom good gain all these becom religi which is good therefor becom religi get all these is good profit design 260 thi answer thu made thi mr money love mr end s question wa highli applaud them all wherefor they conclud whole that it wa most wholesom advantag becaus as they thought no man wa abl contradict it becaus christian hope were yet call they jointli agre assault them question as soon as they overtook them rather becaus they had oppos mr end so they call them they stop stood still till they came them but they conclud as they went that not mr end but old mr hold world should propound question them becaus as they suppos their answer him would be remaind that heat that wa kindl betwixt mr end them their part littl 260 so they came each other short salut mr hold world propound question christian hi fellow bid them answer it if they could chr then said christian even babe religion may answer ten thousand such question if it be unlaw follow christ loav as it is sixth john how much more abomin is it make him religion stalk hors get enjoy world nor do we find ani other than heathen hypocrit devil witch that are thi opinion 261 1 heathen when hamor shechem had mind daughter cattl jacob saw that there wa no way them come them but becom circumcis they say their companion if everi male us be circumcis as they are circumcis shall not their cattl their substanc everi beast their be our their daughter their cattl were that which they sought obtain their religion stalk hors they made use come them read whole stori gen 34 20 23 262 2 hypocrit pharise were also

wa accord act 8 19 22 265 5 neither will it my mind but that that man that take religion world will throw away religion world so sure as juda resign world becom religi so sure did he also sell religion hi master same answer question therefor affirm as i perceiv you have done accept as authent such answer is both heathenish hypocrit devilish your reward will be accord your work then they stood stare one anoth but had not wherewith answer christian hope also approv sound christian s answer so there wa great silenc them mr end hi compani also stagger kept behind that christian hope might outgo them then said christian hi fellow if these men cannot stand sentenc men what will they do sentenc god if they are mute when dealt vessel clay what will they do when they shall be rebuk flame devour fire 266 then christian hope outwent them again went till they came delic plain call eas where they went much content but that plain wa but narrow so they were quickli got it now further side that plain wa littl hill call lucr that hill silver mine which some them that had formerli gone that way becaus rariti it had turn asid see but go too near brink pit ground be deceit them broke they were slain some also had been maim there could not their die day be their own men again 267 then i saw my dream that littl off road against silver mine stood dema gentlemanlik call passeng come see who said christian hi fellow ho turn asid hither i will show you thing chr what thing so deserv as turn us way see it dema here is silver mine some dig it treasur if you will come littl pain you may richli provid yourselv 268 hope then said hope let us go see chr not i said christian i have heard thi place now how mani have there been slain besid that treasur is snare those that seek it it hindereth them their pilgrimag then christian call dema say is not place danger hath it not hinder mani their pilgrimag ho 14 8 dema not veri danger those that are careless but withal he blush as he spake chr then said christian hope let us not stir step but still keep our way hope i will warrant you when end come if he hath same invit as we he will turn thither see chr no doubt thereof hi principl lead him that way hundr one but he die there dema then dema call again say but will you not come see 269 chr then christian roundli answer say dema thou art enemi right way lord thi way hast been alreadi condemn thine own turn asid one hi majesti s judg 2 tim 4 10 whi seekest thou bring us like condemn besid if we all turn asid our lord king will certainli hear thereof will there put us shame where we would stand bold him dema cri again that he also wa one their fratern that if they would tarri littl he also himself would walk them 270 chr then said christian what is thi name is it not same which i have call thee dema ye my name is dema i am son abraham chr i know you gehazi wa your great grandfath juda your father you have trod their step 2 king 5 20 matt 26 14 15 27 1 5 it is but devilish prank that thou usest thi father wa hang traitor thou deservest no better reward assur thyself that when we come king we will do him word thi thi behaviour thu they went their way 271 thi time end hi companion were come again sight they first beck went dema now they fell pit look brink thereof or they went down dig or they were smother bottom damp that commonli aris these thing i am not certain but thi i observ that they never were seen again way then sang christian end silver dema both agre one call other run that he may be sharer hi lucr so these do take thi world no further go 272 now i saw that just other side thi plain pilgrim came place where stood old monument hard highway side sight which they were both concern becaus strang form thereof it seem them as if it had been woman transform shape pillar here therefor they stood look look it but could not time tell what they should make thereof last hope espi written head thereof write unusu hand but he be no scholar call christian he wa learn see if he could pick mean so he came littl lay letter togeth he found same be thi rememb lot s wife so he read it hi fellow which they both conclud that that wa pillar salt which lot s wife wa turn her look back covet heart when she wa go sodom safeti gen 19 26 which sudden amaz sight gave them occas thi discours 273 chr ah my brother thi is season sight it came opportun us invit which dema gave us come view hill lucr had we gone as he desir us as thou wast inclin do my brother we had aught i know been made ourselv like thi woman spectacl those that shall come behold hope i am sorri that i wa so foolish am made wonder that i am not now as lot s wife wherein wa differ betwixt her sin mine she onli look back i had desir go see let grace be ador let me be asham that ever such thing should be mine heart 274 chr let us take notic what we see here our help time come thi woman escap one judgment she fell not destruct sodom yet she wa destroy anoth as we see she is turn pillar salt hope true she may be us both caution exampl caution that we should shun her sin or sign what judgment will overtak such as shall not be prevent thi caution so korah dathan abiram two hundr fifti men that perish their sin did also becom sign or exampl other bewar num 26 9 10 but all i muse one thing wit how dema hi fellow can stand so confid yonder look that treasur which thi woman but look behind her we read not that she step one foot way wa turn pillar salt especi judgment which overtook her did make her exampl sight where they are they cannot choos but see her did they but

take heed that they sleep not enchant ground fourth bid them god speed so i awok my dream 307 i slept dream again saw same two pilgrim go down mountain highway citi now littl these mountain left hand lieth countri conceit which countri there come way which pilgrim walk littl crook lane here therefor they met veri brisk lad that came that countri hi name wa ignor so christian ask him what part he

they matter they do or no we have as you see fine pleasant green lane that come down our countri next way way 310 when christian saw that man wa wise hi own conceit he said hope whisperingli there is more hope fool than him prov 26 12 said moreov when he that is fool walketh way hi wisdom faileth him he saith everi one that he is fool eccl 10 3 what shall we talk further him or go him present so leav him think what he hath heard alreadi then stop again him afterward see if degre we can do ani good him then said hope let ignor littl while now muse what is said let him not refus good counsel embrac lest he remain still ignor what s chiefest gain god saith those that no understand have although he made them them he will not save hope he further ad it is not good i think say all him onc let

had bound seven strong cord were carri him back door that they saw side hill matt 12 45 prov 5 22 now good christian began trembl so did hope hi companion yet as devil led away man christian look see if he knew him he thought it might be one turn away that dwelt town apostasi but he did not perfectli see hi face he did hang hi head like thief that is found but be onc past hope look him espi hi

gallop speed now good man wa just awak hi sleep wa get go hi journey so they came all him threaten languag bid him stand thi littl faith look as white as clout had neither power fight nor fli then said faint heart deliv thi purs but he make no hast do it he wa loath lose hi money mistrust ran him thrust hi hand hi pocket pull thenc bag silver then he cri thiev thiev that guilt great club that wa hi hand struck littl faith head that blow fell him flat ground where he lay bleed as one that would bleed death all thi while thiev stood but last they hear that some were road fear lest it should be one great grace that dwell citi good confid they betook themselv their heel left thi good man shift himself now while littl faith came himself get made shift scrabbl hi way thi wa stori 312 hope but did they take him all that ever he had chr no place where hi jewel were they never ransack so those he kept still but as i wa told good man wa much afflict hi loss thiev got most hi spend money that which they got not as i said were jewel also he had littl odd money left but scarc enough bring him hi journey s end 1 peter 4 18 nay if i wa not misinform he wa forc beg as he went keep himself aliv hi jewel he might not sell but beg do what he could he went as we say mani hungri belli most part rest way 313 hope but is it not wonder they got not him hi certif which he wa receiv hi admitt celesti gate chr it is wonder but they got not that though they miss it not ani good cun hi he be dismay their come him had neither power nor skill hide anyth so it wa more good provid than hi endeavour that they miss that good thing 314 hope but it must need be comfort him that they got not hi jewel him chr it might have been great comfort him had he use it as he should but they that told me stori said that he made but littl use it all rest way that becaus dismay that he had take away hi money inde he forgot it great part rest hi journey besid when ani time it came hi mind he began be comfort therewith then would fresh thought hi loss come again him those thought would swallow all 1 peter 1 9 315 hope ala poor man thi could not but be great grief him chr grief ay grief inde would it not have been so ani us had we been use as he be rob wound too that strang place as he wa it is wonder he did not die grief poor heart i wa told that he scatter almost all rest way noth but dole bitter complaint tell also all that overtook him or that he overtook way as he went where he wa rob how who they were that did it what he lost how he wa wound that he hardli escap hi life 316 hope but it is wonder that hi necess did not put him sell or pawn some hi jewel that he might have wherewith reliev himself hi journey chr thou talkest like one whose head is shell thi veri day what should he pawn them or whom should he sell them all that countri where he wa rob hi jewel were not account nor did he want that relief which could thenc be administ him besid had hi jewel been miss gate celesti citi he had that he knew well enough been exclud inherit there that would have been wors him than appear villaini ten thousand thiev 317 hope whi art thou so tart my brother esau sold hi birthright that mess pottag that birthright wa hi greatest jewel if he whi might not littl faith do so too heb 12 16 chr esau did sell hi birthright inde so do mani besid so do exclud themselv chief bless as

belli wa not so esau s want lay hi fleshli appetit littl faith s did not so besid esau could see no further than fulfil hi lust behold i am point die said he what profit shall thi birthright do me gen 25 32 but littl faith though it wa hi lot have but littl faith wa hi littl faith kept such extravag made see prize hi jewel more than sell them as esau did hi birthright you read not anywher that esau had faith no not so much as littl therefor no marvel if where flesh onli bear sway as it will that man where no faith is resist if he sell hi birthright hi soul all that devil hell it is such as it is ass who her occas cannot be turn away jer 2 24 when their mind are set their lust they will have them whatev they cost but littl faith wa anoth temper hi mind wa thing divin hi livelihood wa thing

persuad turtl dove live carrion like crow though faithless one can carnal lust pawn or mortgag or sell what they have themselv outright boot yet they that have faith save faith though but littl it cannot do so here therefor my brother is thi mistak 318 hope i acknowledg it but yet your sever reflect had almost made me angri chr whi i did but compar thee some bird that are brisker sort who will run fro untrodden path shell their head but pass that consid matter debat all shall be well betwixt thee me hope but christian these three fellow i am persuad my heart are but compani coward would they have run els think you as they did nois one that wa come road whi did not littl faith pluck greater heart he might methink have stood one brush them have yield when there had been no remedi chr

some are weak some have great faith some have littl thi man wa one weak therefor he went wall 321 hope i would it had been great grace their sake chr if it had been he might have had hi hand full i must tell you that though great grace is excel good hi weapon ha can so long as he keep them sword s point do well enough them yet if they get him even faint heart mistrust or other it shall go hard but they will throw hi heel when man is down you know what can he do 322 whoso look well great grace s face shall see those scar cut there that shall easili give demonstr what i say yea onc i heard

see c but now we are ourselv what do you think such men have they no time think you convict sin so consequ fear that their state is danger hope nay do you answer that question yourself you are elder man chr then i say sometim as i think they may but they be natur ignor understand not that such convict tend their good therefor they do desper seek stifl them presumptu continu flatter themselv way their own heart 369 hope i do believ as you say that fear tend much men s good make them right their begin go pilgrimag chr all doubt it doth if it be right so say word fear lord is begin wisdom prov 1 7 9 10 job 28 28 ps 111 10 370 hope how will you describ right fear chr true or right fear is discov three thing 1 it rise it is caus save convict sin 2 it driveth soul lay fast hold christ salvat 3

hope well said i believ you have said truth are we now almost got past enchant ground chr whi art thou weari thi discours hope no verili but that i would know where we are 371 chr we have not now two mile further go thereon but let us return our matter now ignor know not that such convict as tend put them fear are their good therefor they seek stifl them hope how do they seek stifl them 372 chr 1 they think that those fear are wrought devil though inde they are wrought god think so they resist them as thing that directli tend their overthrow 2 they also think that these fear tend spoil their

neighbour ignor himself fall anoth profit question hope all my heart but you shall still begin chr well then did you not know ten year ago one temporari your part who wa forward man religion then hope know him ye he dwelt graceless town two mile off honesti he dwelt next door one turnback 374 chr right he dwelt same roof him well that man wa much awaken onc i believ that then he had some sight hi sin wage that were due thereto hope i am your mind my hous not be three mile him he would ofttim come me that mani tear truli i piti man wa not altogeth hope him but one may see it is not everi one that cri lord lord chr he told me onc that he wa resolv go pilgrimag as we do now but all sudden he grew acquaint one save self then he becam stranger me 375 hope now we are talk him let us littl inquir reason sudden backslid him such other chr it may be veri profit but do you begin hope well then there are my judgment four reason it 376 1 though conscienc such men are awaken yet their mind are not chang therefor when power guilt weareth away that which provok them be religi ceaseth wherefor they natur turn their own cours again even as we see dog that is sick what he ha eaten so long as hi sick prevail he vomit cast all not that he doth thi free mind if we may say dog ha mind but becaus it troubleth hi stomach but now when hi sick is so hi stomach eas hi desir be not all alien hi vomit he turn him lick all so it is true which is written dog is turn hi own vomit again 2 pet 2 22 thu i say be hot heaven virtu onli sens fear torment hell as their sens hell fear damnat chill cool so their desir heaven salvat cool also so then it come pass that when their guilt fear is gone their desir heaven happi die they return their cours again 377 2 anoth reason is they have slavish fear that do overmast them i speak now fear that they have men fear man bringeth snare prov 29 25 so then though they seem be hot heaven so long as flame hell are their ear yet when that terror is littl they betak themselv second thought name that it is good be wise not run they know not what hazard lose all or least bring themselv unavoid unnecessari troubl so they fall world again 378 3 shame that attend religion lie also as block their way they are proud haughti religion their eye is low contempt therefor when they have lost their sens hell wrath come they return again their former cours 379 4 guilt medit terror are grievou them they like not see their miseri they come it though perhap sight it first if they love that sight might make them fli whither righteou fli are safe but becaus they do as i hint even shun thought guilt terror therefor when onc they are rid their awaken terror wrath god they harden their heart gladli choos such way as will harden them more more 380 chr you are pretti near busi bottom all is want chang their mind will therefor they are but like felon that standeth judg he quak trembl seem repent most heartili but bottom all is fear halter not that he hath ani detest offenc as is evid becaus let but thi man have hi liberti he will be thief so rogu still wherea if hi mind wa chang he would be otherwis 381 hope now i have show you reason their go back do you show me manner thereof chr so i will willingli 1 they draw off their thought all that they may remembr god death judgment come 2 then they cast off degre privat duti as closet prayer curb their lust watch sorrow sin like 3 then they shun compani live warm christian 4 that they grow cold public duti as hear read godli confer like 5 then they begin pick hole as we say coat some godli that devilishli that they may have seem colour throw religion sake some infirm they have espi them behind their back 6 then they begin adher associ themselv carnal loos wanton men 7 then they give way carnal wanton discours secret glad are they if they can see such thing ani that are count honest that they may more boldli do it their exampl 8 thi they begin play littl sin openli 9 then be harden they show themselv as they are thu be launch again gulf miseri unless miracl grace prevent it they everlastingli perish their own deceiv 382 now i saw my dream that thi time pilgrim were got enchant
