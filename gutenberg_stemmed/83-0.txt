will be period transit projectil when endow suffici initi veloc consequ what moment ought it be discharg order that it may touch moon particular point 4 what precis moment will moon present herself most favor posit be reach projectil 5 what point heaven ought cannon be aim which is intend discharg projectil 6 what place will moon occupi heaven moment projectil s departur _first_ question is it possibl transmit projectil moon _answer _ ye provid it possess initi veloc 1 200 yard second calcul prove that be suffici proport as we reced earth action gravit diminish invers ratio squar distanc that is say _at three time given distanc action is nine time less _ consequ weight shot will decreas will becom reduc _zero_ instant that attract moon exactli counterpois that earth that is say 47 52 it passag that instant projectil will have no weight whatev if it pass that point it will fall moon sole effect lunar attract _theoret possibility_ experi is therefor absolut demonstr it _success_ must depend power engin employ as _second_ question what is exact distanc which separ earth it satellit _answer _ moon doe not describ _circle_ round earth but rather _ellipse_ which our earth occupi one _foci_ consequ therefor is that certain time it approach nearer other it reced farther earth astronom languag it is one time _apogee_ anoth _perigee_ now differ it greatest it least distanc is too consider be left consider point fact it apoge moon is 247 552 mile it perige 218 657 mile onli distant fact which make differ 28 895 mile or more than one ninth entir distanc perige distanc therefor is that which ought serv as basi all calcul _third_ question _answer _ if shot should preserv continu it initi veloc 12 000 yard second it would requir littl more than nine hour reach it destin but inasmuch as that initi veloc will be continu decreas it will occupi 300 000 second that is 83hr 20m reach point where attract earth moon will be _in equilibrio_ thi point it will fall moon 50 000 second or 13hr 53m 20sec it will be desir therefor discharg it 97hr 13m 20sec arriv moon point aim question _four_ what precis moment will moon present herself most favor posit etc _answer _ what ha been said it will be necessari first all choos period when moon will be perige _also_ moment when she will be cross zenith which latter event will further diminish entir distanc length equal radiu earth _i e _ 3 919 mile result which will be that final passag remain be accomplish will be 214 976 mile but although moon pass her perige everi month she doe not reach zenith alway _at exactli same moment_ she doe not appear these two condit simultan long interv time it will be necessari therefor wait moment when her passag perige shall coincid that zenith now fortun circumst 4th decemb ensu year moon _will_ present these two condit midnight she will be perige that is her shortest distanc earth same moment she will be cross zenith _fifth_ question what point heaven ought cannon be aim _answer _ preced remark be admit cannon ought be point zenith place it fire therefor will be perpendicular plane horizon projectil will soonest pass rang terrestri attract but order that moon should reach zenith given place it is necessari that place should not exceed latitud declin luminari other word it must be compris degre 0 28 lat n or s everi other spot fire must necessarili be obliqu which would serious milit against success experi as _sixth_ question what place will moon occupi heaven moment projectil s departur _answer _ moment when projectil shall be discharg space moon which travel daili forward 13 10 35 will be distant zenith point four time that quantiti _i e _ 52 41 20 space which correspond path which she will describ entir journey projectil but inasmuch as it is equal necessari take account deviat which rotari motion earth will impart shot as shot cannot reach moon deviat equal 16 radii earth which calcul moon s orbit are equal eleven degre it becom necessari add these eleven degre those which express retard moon just mention that is say round number sixti four degre consequ moment fire visual radiu appli moon will describ vertic line place angl sixti four

exact observ notic that projectil wa appar stationari then rise wipe hi forehead which larg drop perspir were stand he put some figur paper nichol understood that presid wa deduct terrestri diamet projectil s distanc earth he watch him anxious no exclaim barbican some moment no we are not fall no we are alreadi more than 50 000 leagu earth we have pass point which projectil would have stop if it speed had onli been 12 000 yard start we are still go that is evid repli nichol we must conclud that our initi speed power 400 000 pound gun cotton must have exceed requir 12 000 yard now i can understand how thirteen minut onli we met second satellit which gravit round earth more than 2 000 leagu distanc thi explan is more probabl ad barbican becaus throw off water enclos it partit break projectil found itself lighten consider weight just so said nichol ah my brave nichol we are save veri well then said michel ardan quietli as we are safe let us have breakfast nichol wa not mistaken initi speed had been veri fortun much that estim cambridg observatori but cambridg observatori had nevertheless made mistak travel recov thi fals alarm breakfast merrili if they ate good deal they talk more their confid wa greater than incid algebra whi should we not succeed said michel ardan whi should we not arriv safe we are launch we have no obstacl us no stone way road is open more so than that ship battl sea more open than that balloon battl wind if ship can reach it destin balloon go where it pleas whi cannot our projectil attain it end aim it _will_ attain it said barbican if onli do honor american ad michel ardan onli peopl who could bring such enterpris happi termin onli one which could produc presid barbican ah now we are no longer uneasi i begin think what will becom us we shall get right royal weari barbican nichol made gestur denial but i have provid conting my friend repli michel you have onli speak i have chess draught card domino your dispos noth is want but billiard tabl what exclaim barbican you brought away such trifl certainli repli michel not onli distract ourselv but also laudabl intent endow selenit smoke divan them my friend said barbican if moon is inhabit it inhabit must have appear some thousand year those earth we cannot doubt that their star is much older than our if then these selenit have exist their hundr thousand year if their brain is same organ human brain they have alreadi invent all that we have invent even what we may invent futur age they have noth learn _us_ we have everyth learn _them_ what said michel you believ that they have artist like phidia michael angelo or raphael ye poet like homer virgil milton lamartin hugo i am sure it philosoph like plato aristotl descart kant i have no doubt it scientif men like archimed euclid pascal newton i could swear it comic writer like arnal photograph like like nadar certain then friend barbican if they are as strong as we are even stronger these selenit whi have they not tri commun earth whi have they not launch lunar projectil our terrestri region who told you that they have never done so said barbican serious inde ad nichol it would be easier them than us two reason first becaus attract moon s surfac is six time less than that earth which would allow projectil rise more easili secondli becaus it would be enough send such projectil onli 8 000 leagu instead 80 000 which would requir forc project be ten time less strong then continu michel i repeat it whi have they not done it i repeat said barbican who told you that they have not done it when thousand year man appear earth projectil where is projectil i demand see projectil my friend repli barbican sea cover five sixth our globe that we may draw five good reason suppos that lunar projectil if ever launch is now bottom atlant or pacif unless it sped some crevass that period when crust earth wa not yet harden old barbican said michel you have answer everyth i bow your wisdom but there is one hypothesi that would suit me better than all other which is selenit be older than we are wiser have not invent gunpowd thi moment diana join convers sonor bark she wa ask her breakfast ah said michel ardan our discuss we have forgotten diana satellit immedi good size pie wa given dog which devour it hungrili do you see barbican said michel we should have made second noah s ark thi projectil born us moon coupl everi kind domest anim i dare say but room would have fail us oh said michel we might have squeez littl fact is repli nichol that cow bull hors all rumin would have been veri use lunar contin but unfortun car could neither have been made stabl nor shed well we might have least brought donkey onli littl donkey that courag beast which old silenu love mount i love those old donkey they are least favor anim creation they are not onli beaten while aliv but even they are dead how do you make that ask barbican whi said michel they make their skin drum barbican nichol could not help laugh thi ridicul remark but cri their merri companion stop them latter wa lean spot where satellit lay he rose say my good satellit is no longer ill ah said nichol no answer michel he is dead there ad he piteou tone that is embarrass i much fear my poor diana that you will leav no progeni lunar region inde unfortun satellit had not surviv it wound it wa quit dead michel ardan look hi friend rueful counten one question present itself said barbican we cannot keep dead bodi thi dog us next forti eight hour no certainli not repli nichol but our scuttl are fix hing they can be let down we will open one throw bodi space presid thought some moment then said ye we must do so but same time take veri great precaut whi ask michel two reason which you will understand answer barbican first relat air shut projectil which we must lose as littl as possibl but we manufactur air onli part we make onli oxygen my worthi michel regard that we must watch that apparatu doe not furnish oxygen too great quantiti excess would bring us veri seriou physiolog troubl but if we make oxygen we do not make azot that medium which lung do not absorb which ought remain intact that azot will escap rapidli open scuttl oh time throw poor satellit said michel agre but we must act quickli second reason ask michel second reason is that we must not let outer cold which is excess penetr projectil or we shall be frozen death but sun sun warm our projectil which absorb it ray but it doe not warm vacuum which we are float thi moment where there is no air there is no more heat than diffus light same dark it is cold where sun s ray do not strike direct thi temperatur is onli temperatur produc radiat star that is say what terrestri globe would undergo if sun disappear one day which is not be fear repli nichol who know said michel ardan but admit that sun doe not go might it not happen that earth might move away it there said barbican there is michel hi idea continu michel do we not know that 1861 earth pass tail comet or let us suppos comet whose power attract is greater than that sun terrestri orbit will bend wander star earth becom it satellit will be drawn such distanc that ray sun will have no action it surfac that _might_ happen inde repli barbican but consequ such displac need not be so formid as you suppos whi not becaus heat cold would be equal our globe it ha been calcul that had our earth been carri it cours comet 1861 it perihelion that is it nearest approach sun it would have undergon heat 28 000 time greater than that summer but thi heat which is suffici evapor water would have form thick ring cloud which would have modifi that excess temperatur henc compens cold aphelion heat perihelion how mani degre ask nichol is temperatur planetari space estim formerli repli barbican it wa greatli exager but now calcul fourier french academi scienc it is not suppos exceed 60 centigrad zero pooh said michel that s noth it is veri much repli barbican temperatur which wa observ polar region melvil island fort relianc that is 76 fahrenheit zero if i mistak not said nichol m pouillet anoth savant estim temperatur space 250 fahrenheit zero we shall howev be abl verifi these calcul ourselv not present becaus solar ray beat directli our thermomet would give contrari veri high temperatur but when we arriv moon it fifteen day night either face we shall have leisur make experi our satellit lie vacuum what do you mean vacuum ask michel is it perfectli such it is absolut void air is air replac noth whatev ether onli repli barbican pray what is ether ether my friend is agglomer imponder atom which rel their dimens are as far remov each other as celesti bodi are space it is these atom which their vibratori motion produc both light heat univers they now proceed burial satellit they had mere drop him space same way that sailor drop bodi sea but as presid barbican suggest they must act quickli so as lose as littl as possibl that air whose elast would rapidli have

breakfast question michel s relat projectil provok rather curiou answer barbican which is worth repeat michel suppos it be roughli stop while still it formid initi speed wish know what consequ stoppag

it speed would diminish degre it would not have stop suddenli admit that it had struck bodi space what bodi whi that enorm meteor which we met then said nichol projectil would have been broken thousand piec we it more than that repli barbican we should have been burn death burn exclaim michel jove i am sorri it did not happen just see you would have seen repli barbican it is known now that heat is onli modif motion when water is warm that is say when heat is ad it it particl are set motion well said michel that is ingeni theori true one my worthi friend it explain everi phenomenon calor heat is but motion atom simpl oscil particl bodi when they appli brake train train come stop but what becom motion which it had previous possess it is transform heat brake becom hot whi do they greas

larg drop whi am i oblig stop simpli becaus my motion is chang heat barbican could not help smile michel s repli then return hi theori said thu case shock it would have been our projectil as ball which fall burn state have struck metal plate it is it motion which is turn heat consequ i affirm that if our projectil had struck meteor it speed thu suddenli check would have rais heat great enough turn it vapor instantan then ask nichol what would happen if earth s motion were stop suddenli her temperatur would be rais such pitch said barbican that she would be onc reduc vapor well said michel that is way end earth which will greatli simplifi thing if earth fell sun ask nichol accord calcul repli barbican fall would develop heat equal that produc 16 000 globe coal each equal bulk our terrestri globe good addit heat sun repli michel ardan which inhabit uranu or neptun would doubtless not complain they must be perish cold their planet thu my friend said barbican all motion suddenli stop produc heat thi theori allow us infer that heat solar disc is fed hail meteor fall incessantli it surfac they have even calcul oh dear murmur michel figur are come they have even calcul continu imperturb barbican that shock each meteor sun ought produc heat equal that 4 000 mass coal equal bulk what is solar heat ask michel it is equal that produc combust stratum coal surround sun depth forti seven mile that heat would be abl boil two billion nine hundr million cubic myriamet 2 water 2 myriamet is equal rather more than 10 936 cubic yard english it doe not roast us exclaim michel no repli barbican becaus terrestri atmospher absorb four tenth solar heat besid quantiti heat intercept earth is but billionth part entir radiat i see that all is best said michel that thi atmospher is use invent it not onli allow us breath but it prevent us roast ye said nichol unfortun it will not be same moon bah said michel alway hope if there are inhabit they must breath if there are no longer ani they must have left enough oxygen three peopl if onli bottom ravin where it own weight will caus it accumul we will not climb mountain that is all michel rise went look lunar disc which shone

that planetari space pretti countri that exclaim michel never mind i wish i wa there ah my dear comrad it will be rather curiou have earth our moon see it rise horizon recogn shape it contin say oneself there is america there is europ then follow it when it is lose itself sun s ray bye barbican have selenit eclips ye eclips sun repli barbican when center three orb are line earth be middl but they are onli partial which earth cast like screen solar disc allow greater portion be seen whi ask nichol is there no total eclips doe not cone shadow cast earth extend moon ye if we do not take consider refract produc terrestri atmospher no if we take that refract consider thu let lower case delta be horizont parallel _p_ appar semidiamet oh said michel do speak plainli you man algebra veri well repli barbican popular languag mean distanc moon earth be sixti terrestri radii length cone shadow account refract is reduc less than forti two radii result is that when there are eclips moon find itself cone pure shadow that sun send her it ray not onli it edg but also it center then said michel merri tone whi are there eclips when there ought not be ani simpli becaus solar ray are weaken thi refract atmospher which they pass extinguish greater part them that reason satisfi me repli michel besid we shall see when we get there now tell me barbican do you believ that moon is old comet there s idea ye repli michel amiabl swagger i have few idea that sort but that idea doe not spring michel answer nichol well then i am plagiarist no doubt it accord ancient arcadian pretend that their ancestor inhabit earth moon becam her satellit start thi fact some scientif men have seen moon comet whose orbit will one day bring it so near earth that it will be held there it attract is there ani truth thi hypothesi ask michel none whatev said barbican proof is that moon ha preserv no trace gaseou envelop which alway accompani comet but continu nichol becom earth s satellit could not moon when her perihelion pass so near sun as evapor get rid all those gaseou substanc it is possibl friend nichol but not probabl whi not becaus faith i do not know ah exclaim michel what hundr volum we might
