them make their situat more comfort than it wa hi power do perhap it would have been as well if he had left it wholli myself he could hardli suppos i should neglect them but as he requir promis i could not do less than give it least i thought so time promis therefor wa given must be perform someth must be done them whenev they leav norland settl new home well then _let_ someth be done them but _that_ someth need not be three thousand pound consid she ad that when money is onc part it never can return your sister will marri it will be gone ever if inde it could be restor our poor littl boy

be sure it would perhap then it would be better all parti if sum were diminish one half five hundr pound would be prodigi increas their fortun oh anyth great what brother earth would do half so much hi sister even if _really_ hi sister as it is onli half blood but you have such gener spirit i would not wish do ani thing mean he repli one had rather such occas do too much than too littl no one least can think i have not done enough them even themselv they can hardli expect more there is no know what _they_ may expect said ladi but we are not think their expect question is what you can afford do certainli i think i may afford give them five hundr pound piec as it is ani addit mine they will each have three thousand pound their mother s death veri comfort fortun ani young woman be sure it is inde it strike me that they can want no addit all they will have ten thousand pound divid them if they marri they will be sure do well if they do not they may all live veri comfort togeth interest ten thousand pound that is veri true therefor i do not know whole it would not be more advis do someth their mother while she live rather than them someth annuiti kind i mean my sister would feel good effect it as well as herself hundr year would make them all perfectli comfort hi wife hesit littl howev give her consent thi plan be sure said she it is better than part fifteen hundr pound onc but then if mr dashwood should live fifteen year we shall be complet taken fifteen year my dear fanni her life cannot be worth half that purchas certainli not but if you observ peopl alway live
